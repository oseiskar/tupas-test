### No-backend HTML+JavaScript app for testing TUPAS

[TUPAS](https://www.fkl.fi/en/themes/e-services/tupas/Pages/default.aspx) is a method used by Finnish banks to provide strong authentication services to other websites.

This [page](http://oseiskar.github.io/tupas-test/) can be used to test TUPAS on your website. It also includes the test credential of various banks, taken from https://github.com/reaktor/node-tupas. This test page should also work as a local copy of [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oseiskar/tupas-test/master/index.html) on your machine.
